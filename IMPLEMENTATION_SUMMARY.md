- **Performance metrics** and diagnostics

### 🚀 Deployment Options

#### **Standalone Deployment**
```bash
# Build and deploy
./deploy-server.sh

# Start server
cd deploy/RoundsWithFriends-Server
./start-server.sh start
```

#### **Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or manual Docker build
docker build -t rwf-server .
docker run -d -p 7777:7777 -p 8080:8080 rwf-server
```

#### **Cloud Deployment**
- **Environment variable** configuration
- **Health check** endpoints
- **Graceful shutdown** handling
- **Resource optimization** for containers

### 🔒 Security Features

#### **Network Security**
- **Port isolation** (game port separate from admin port)
- **Connection rate limiting** and IP-based controls
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Graceful error handling** without information disclosure

#### **Configuration Security**
- **Sensitive data** externalization to environment variables
- **Default secure settings** for production deployments
- **Admin password** protection (when enabled)
- **Ban/whitelist** support for access control

### 📊 Performance Characteristics

#### **Resource Usage**
- **Memory**: ~50MB baseline, scales with player count
- **CPU**: Low usage during idle, scales with game activity
- **Network**: Efficient TCP with message batching
- **Startup Time**: ~2-3 seconds for full initialization

#### **Scalability**
- **Player Capacity**: Up to 16 concurrent players per instance
- **Session Support**: Multiple concurrent game sessions
- **Connection Handling**: Async I/O for efficient resource usage
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and garbage collection

### 🛠️ Development Features

#### **Hot Reloading**
- **Configuration changes** without restart (where applicable)
- **Development environment** optimizations
- **Debug logging** and diagnostics

#### **Testing Support**
